## About this PR
<!-- 
Link the related issue if any.
-->
Closes # 
<!-- 
  - What is the bug/feature you make ? (If describe in the issue, don't repeat yourself, tell us)
  - Any other changes not in the issue ? Why did you add them ?
  - Add some scope to the changes if relevant
  - Try to give as much context as possible without any technical stuff here.

  For example : 
  We need some CGU in our app that the user must accept before doing anythig. See issue #42 for more informations.

  In this PR I've created : 
  - The CGU structure/database with a version for each CGU
  - the API to get the current CGU version for the user. 
  - The business logic to validate the CGU
  What is Out of scope : 
  - The mix task to create a new CGU
  - The Admin API to manage the CGU

  This is only back-end related stuff. For the front-end part, see this issue : #1337

## Technical highlight/advice
<!-- 
    This part is for technical stuff.
    - Tell us what did you change to implement the feature or fix the bug.
    - Don't detail it too much if it's simple stuff.
    - Add more information if you made significant changes that can affect others.

    For example : 
    To create the new API, I've created a new `CGUController` and a `CGU` Context.
    2 new routes : 
     - GET /api/cgu
     - POST /api/cgu/accept
    I've created a new table in the database with a migration.
    The CGU is linked to the user (Many to Many).
    I've added the rule to deny anyone that did not accept the CGU.
